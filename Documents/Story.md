## Father & son roadtrip

It was bright and early and they had a long road ahead before making it to the woods. This didn't bother James and his dad since they would sing and laugh all the way. It seemed as the sunrise was painting beautiful pictures in the sky, the brightest of colors accompanied by the birds singing in celebration of what would become an amazing day. To the sound of the classics, father and son sang along filling the car with joyful melodies. 
After a short three hour drive, they arrived to their destination, you could really see the excitement in James' face as he jumped off the car and stared in awe at the pines and trees that seemed to touch the sky. He looked up and saw nature's perfect balance. As his dad unpacked the rest of the camping geaar they had brought, he approached James and pointed at a particular tree and told him to look closely and feel the lifetimes that tree had already lived. The experiences that it had witnessed, and how many more fahter and sons had already been where they were standing, James would never forget this moment, and live by that connection going forward. 

So the walk began, they had no course whatsoever, guided only by their desire for adventure. They soon reached a peaceful lake where they were the only ones there. 
James asked his dad to teach him how to rock skip and time flew by. The sun was at its highest point, the lake and the forested blended as one and it was as if the rest of the world shut down, it was just them and the lake. His dad took him on his shoulders and kept walking through the woods and up a small mountain wehre they would camp out for the night. As they walked, James would cover his dad's eyes and guide him through the path, that moment would last forever. 

They reached the top just in time to watch the sunset, all the trees suddenly felt small and just a part of the whole picture they were contemplating. As the gave its final brush strokes in the sky, they started a fire to keep themselves warm and cozy.  

As they stared into the sky, it felt as if each of the stars became alive while watching them, all of the sudden, a light show had just began just for them to enjoy, James knew that whenever he looked up to the sky, he would see the reminder of the wonderful day he shared with hi dad, one that time could never wash away.
